            <li>&#x1F9D1; <b>Work</b> I currently work as data scientist scientist at InfoCamere, the IT company of the Italian Chambers of Commerce. In pactical terms I do planning and project management support for the statistics and advanced data analysis unit. I develop machine learning solutions related to the world of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). I support in defining dashboarding and data visualization solutions, from proposal writing to automated quality checks on deployed dashboards. I love to interact with stakeholders and convince them on why it is a good idea in investing in advanced data analysis (when it is the case!).</li>

	<p>I have a PhD in Health Economics obtained at <a href="https://www.city.ac.uk/about/schools/arts-social-sciences/economics">City, University of London</a>. My research work focused on the economic analysos of antibiotics. Essentially I was looking into estimating the impact of a wise use of antibiotics by individual GPs and what could policy makers do about it. In other terms: lots of econometrics, spatial and counter-factual analysis<p>.
	
	<p>I'm highly committed to learning, which I try to do every day (both at work and at home). I am currently working on deepening my SQL and version control skills.<p>
	
	<p>I find the term Data Scientist exteremely confusing. I believe that every data analysis should start with asking <em>why<em> are we doing it and for <em>who<em>. Targeting an analysis to your audience is key. I am a big fan of reproducibility in both science and data analysis work. I get angry when I see complex algos been applied to data before understanding its key properties.<p>   
		
	<p>On a personal nopte I'm Italian, from Venice. I've lived in London for 5 roaring years, before moving back to Italy with my beautiful wife<p>.
