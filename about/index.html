	<h1>Hi there, I'm Nick!</h1>
	<p>I'm Nick Stamboglis, currently data scientist at InfoCamere the IT company of the Italian Chambers of Commerce. I love writing about my journey in data and on data science more generally.
	
	I live in Venice (Italy) with my wife and my beautiful daughter. In my free time I love to read, run and when I manage to play clarinet.
