**TLDR**: Learning SQL is great fun. I highly recommend it for every data professional. No point learning advanced techniques if you don't know the basics. SQL is a great tool to develop a basics mindset (and more!). Love subqueries, the functions PARTITION BY, CASE and indexes. Order matters.

Ok, after thinking about it for some time I've finally made the decision to get started with Danny MA's <a href="https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/">8  Weeks SQL Challenge</a>. The decision was easy (SQL is a key skill), the implementation a bit harder (just had a 3-months old toddler). Commit to this work was the turnaround. Working in small sprints made it happen.

I already know a bit about SQL and I use it professionally at work. So why starting this challenge? Why not jumping straight into deep learning? Well for two reasons: first, I wanted to make sure I actually know what I am speaking about and not just solve context-specific problems, second, I wanted to boost my confidence and finally state that I know advanced SQL (F-You Impostor Syndrome!).

So, here's how the first week went.

**Welcome to Dannys'**

Danny Ma provides a great tool to learn SQL with real-life examples. Danny is a gourmant (he loves good food). In a few clicks you enter his diner where you can explore his customers' favourite food. I love the exercises as they are realistic. Also, you can test-drive them in a dedicated environment which makes it helpful (although in other tools such a <a href="https://dbeaver.io/">DBeaver</a> the error messages are bit clearer).

**Anatomy of a query**

I love thinking in SQL terms. The required mindset is quite different from the data-analysis one. I am trained as an economist, hence when I think about data issues I have a regression-mindset: 

<ul>
  <li>What explains what?</li>
  <li>Where does partial correlation lies?</li>
  <li>How robust such partial-correlation is likely to be?</li>
</ul>

When it comes to SQL I find the approach to be rather different. When I do SQL i think in terms of nested cubes, or matryoshka dolls. I see the problem at hand and I try to address it in consecutive steps: 

<ul>
  <li>What data structure would make the problem clearer?</li>
  <li>What features do I need to add to get my answer?</li>
  <li>Which aggregations are needed to summarize the answer?</li>
</ul>

Getting into this mindset greatly helps in communicating with my fellow data engineers at work.

**Week 1: no jokes**
Let's get things out of the way: you can find the complete set of my answers <a href="https://github.com/nstamboglis/8WeekSQLChallenge/blob/main/DM8WSC_W1.sql">here</a>. If you know of better ways to approach the problem please let me know (seriously). If you see any bug please come knock at my door (even more serious here). Below I'll speak about the stuff I've learnt and that I loved the most (as it is reproducible for future cases).

<emph>Sub-queries:<emph>

<emph>Partition by:<emph>

<emph>Case When:<emph>

<emph>Indexes:<emph>

<emph>Bonus point: style & order matter!<emph>

**Next steps**

Completing the first week was a motivation booster for me. Now I plan to learn the resources and explore other peoples' solutions. I'd like to make sure I'm approaching the tasks correctly rather than progressing with faulty ways. Once the challenge will be completed I plan to purchase Dannys' solutions to make sure I got them right (price is reasonable).
