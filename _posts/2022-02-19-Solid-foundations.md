title: "Building on solid foundations"

Upon embarking into grad school, a good <a href="https://www.unive.it/data/persone/5591182">good professor of mine</a> warned me against the risk of "<emph>lacks of foundations"</emph>. At first I've registered this phrase as something obvious. "Of course one needs foundations to do things properly", that was my thought. 

Luckily, this phrase resonated with me for a while and somehow found a solid spot laying on the back of mymind as I've embarked in my new adventure.

Almost ten years later that phrase is still very much alive in my brain. Living in an historical period where change has never been faster (thank you liquid society!), embarking oneself into the goal of mastering a technical skill might feel overwheling. So many things to know, so much change in tools and techniques, so many smart people whose skills appear to be out of reach. Impostor sindrome at its best! 

At the same time, the wide and ill-defined world of data science appears to be populated by talented individuals who come from different backgrouds, from IT to research and everything in between. Here lays another regularity: everybody has some holes in their preparations which they need to address.

So, here is a potential solution to deal with chaos: <emph>investing into own's foundations</emph>.

Ok, cool words, but what does it mean in practice? After some search online I've randomly found this post by <a href="https://www.datawithdanny.com/">Danny Ma</a>:

I like his approach.
