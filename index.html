	<h1>Hi there, I'm Nick.</h1>
	<p>I am an experienced data professional with a keen interest in economic analysis.</p> 
	
	<p>I am currently working as a data scientist at <a href="https://www.infocamere.it/en/">InfoCamere</a> where I develop advanced analytics, data viz and machine learning solutions. I also provide planning support for the whole team (approx 10 people) plus (some) project management.</p>
				
	<p>I enjoy framing ideas into workable solutions, learn constantly and describe complex concepts to varied audiences. I love R. I am commited on developing my Git and SQL skills. Currently interested in leadership.</p>
	
	<p>I live in Venice (Italy) with my beautiful wife Giovanna and my amazing and brand new daughter Sofia. Whenever I have some free time I love reading, writing, run, hyke and play clarinet.</p>
	
	<p>A fun thing I do is to co-host <a href="https://twitter.com/DataBeersPD">Databeers Padua</a>, the Paduan chapter of Databeers, an international format for informal data-culture events. We basically watch fun data-related presentations while drinking beer with friends.</p>
